Kernel Density Based Linear Regression
Kernel Density-Based Linear Regression (KDLR) is a sophisticated regression technique that integrates the principles of kernel density estimation with traditional linear regression. Traditional regression methods often fall short in scenarios involving noise, outliers, or datasets with complex patterns. By dynamically weighting data points based on their density, KDLR addresses these limitations, prioritizing densely clustered data points and minimizing the influence of outliers. This report delves into the mathematical foundations of KDLR, highlights its advantages over traditional methods, and explores its applications across domains such as finance, healthcare, and environmental modelling. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that KDLR not only enhances robustness and accuracy but also effectively captures subtle data patterns, making it a promising alternative for real-world predictive tasks.
